# Young Tista

This is a simple Python CLI tool to interact with GPT-3's completion API. Fed the AI my past blog posts and used it to be able to ask anything to my younger me.

## Running & Installation

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:tistaharahap/young-tista.git
$ cd young-tista
$ poetry shell
$ poetry install
$ tista --help
```

When you run without the `--help` flag, it will ask you to input a question. The question will be sent to the AI and the response will be printed out.
